### Documentation

Widget visibility can be configured under individual widget settings under "Appearance â†’ Widgets" in your WordPress administration area or through the widget editing interface in the Customizer.

#### Target by URL

The "Target by URL" is a powerful feature for targeting sections of your website based on the request URLs. It was inspired by a similar feature in the [Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org).

Use relative URLs such as `page/sub-page` instead of absolute URLs `https://example.com/page/sub-page` because relative URLs are more flexible and make the logic portable between different domains and server environments.

##### Wildcards

Use the wildcard symbol `*` for matching dynamic parts of the URL. For example:

- `topic/widgets/*` to match all posts in the widgets category, if your permalink structure is set to `/topic/%category%/%postname%`.

- `page-slug/*` to match all child pages of the page-slug parent page.

- Use a trailing `?*` to capture URL with all query arguments such as `utm_source`, etc. For example, for every `blog/post-slug` also include `blog/post-slug?*`.

#### Exclude by URL

Specify URLs to ignore even if they're matched by any of the other context rules. For example, enter `example/sub-page` to hide a widget on this page even when "All Posts" is selected under "Global Sections".


## Installation

- Search for **Widget Context** under "Plugins â†’ Add New" in your WordPress dashboard.
- Widget Context settings will appear automatically under **each widget** under "Appearance â†’ Widgets".
- Visit "Settings â†’ Widget Context" to configure the available widget visibility contexts.
